# Reading Zargana

Alvin gave me Destined today. Zargana's book.

I read Dusted first—Ratt's story. He sees himself as a burden she's stuck with. A monster who keeps failing to die.

Now I'm reading her side. Her earliest memory is pride turning into a beating. Val sang her to sleep when she was a child.

The same Val who dies offscreen in Ratt's book.

That's what interlaced narrative does—it makes you see the gaps as losses.
